The unique photos of the home, whose personal taste set it aside from others, were revealed after her death. Despite fame and wealth, Elizabeth loved the cozy atmosphere and hanging out with friends and grandchildren — they spoke out about her as a grandmom.</p><p class=dh>Elizabeth Taylor was born to socially prominent American parents, and when she was only seven, her family moved to Los Angeles. She began her career as a child star in the '60s, making her acting debut in "There's one born every minute," then becoming a popular teen with her role in "National Velvet" in 1944.</p><p class=dh>The '50s saw her transition into more mature roles, appearing in the 1950 comedy "Father of the Bride" and "A Piece in the Sun" the following year. Her other acting credits include the epic drama "Giant," "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," and "Suddenly, Last Summer," for which she won a Golden Globe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/20d4f92214a9ff72f4f1188706e1848764fd6cc4aa163adaaf0ac66accdf2bc6.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Elizabeth Taylor. Circa. 1950s. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>She rose so fast in her career that she had become one of the most popular stars of classical Hollywood cinema by the time the '50s clocked in. She carried the torch for years until her career started dwindling by the late '60s. Nevertheless, she continued starring in films until the mid-70s, after which she focused on supporting her sixth husband, United States Senator John Warner's career.</p><p class=dh>For a woman that grew up and lived in the limelight all her life, Taylor was an exceptionally wonderful mother to her children, Michael, Christopher, Elisabeth, and Maria Burton, an achievement she was incredibly proud of.</p><p class=dh>Taylor was a doting mother to her kids and a loving grandmother to their children until she waved the world goodbye. But that was only part of her charm. She also remained a popular public figure for the rest of her life, not only for her unmatched contribution to the industry or her boldface persona but also for her unbridled natural beauty — one of the main reasons people remember her today.</p><p class=dh>People who met her remember her for her authenticity, passion, and amazing violet eyes. Designer Valentino, who met the actress in the '60s, recalls Taylor as a woman who would dress up for any occasion with the most fabulous dress and jewelry, but when she was home, she loved a laid-back life with friends and good food.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/56ceb007dcffcec6e94ec1d978c1d3d725addd36168b79c31053f9d54b4b29d1.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Elizabeth Taylor with Richard Burton and children Michael Wilding, Christopher Wilding, Elisabeth Todd and Maria Burton in 1967. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>But besides her beauty, Taylor loved a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/elizabeth-taylor-home-article>stylish and colorful home</a> that reflected her care and embrace of her <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.facebook.com/elizabethtaylor/posts/pfbid0EPGoVqmAVmvBMwSFoce6jqRLm9evkfjKXw5UydP3yTficenX1ydDTf3uey4rVj4sl>children</a> and friends. Many photographers and designers she met in her life attest to how full of love and warmth she was.</p><p class=dh>Waldo Fernandez, an interior designer, remembers when he came to see her in 1984, and she told him her desire to have a white theme all across the home, including white carpets and furniture. Despite his attempt to talk her out of it, noting that white was not ideal for her home because she had dogs and cats, she was adamant, and that's what she got. Fernandez <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/elizabeth-taylor-home-article>recalled</a>:</p><p class=dh>"White doesn't stay white for long, though, so we had things cleaned and recovered a lot."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/d24a5cdbde802971d76cd7ff70cdc615d0bcd1dd1f5eb55f3b4f16e4e4f2956e.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Actress Elizabeth Taylor at home with her baby son Michael.

Singer Cher says Taylor's style was beyond what many know it to be, but whenever she visited the actress, it was not the house decor nor her sense of style that stood out, but her smile and warmth.</p><p class=dh>Her dedication to family was a breath of fresh air. And despite being a celebrity of her caliber, and status, she raised her babies with good ethics, morals, and manners and was a mother and grandmother first before the fame.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Elizabeth Had 'A Special Place' in the Garden and 'Always Things Children Would Like'</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Taylor's home on 700 Nimes Road in Bel Air, Westside Los Angeles, California, was a sight to behold.

Her bedroom showed a high bed dressed in Pratesi linens and Schumacher wallpaper. As part of the decor in the room was a painting of a deer, done by Taylor as a teenager.</p><p class=dh>Her bedside table held framed photos of her parents, while the bedroom sitting area boasted beautiful floral chairs and a table by French artist Émile Gallé.</p><p class=dh>And her taste in jewelry was no less refined. Taylor always said that a big girl needed big diamonds, and she did not hold back when choosing hers. Her collection of stones, crystals, and pearls was breathtaking, as was one of her engagement rings, a Krupp Diamond. Her diamonds were auctioned shortly after her demise and were reportedly worth $183.5 million.</p><p class=dh>As the pioneer of celebrity-branded perfumes, Taylor created a collection of fragrances that was a huge success and helped pave the way for the trend in later years.

Instead, what stood out was her love of family, evidenced by the numerous photos of her twice-married husband, Richard Burton, and other family members. Countless photos of her children and grandchildren adorned many a surface in the home.</p><p class=dh>The outside of her home was not any less elegant. She took pride in her garden, perhaps as a homage to her English roots. It started with her telling the landscape designer Nicholas Walker that she wanted to duplicate an authentic English herbaceous border.</p><p class=dh>She specifically wanted delphiniums all year round, but the weather in California could not allow that. However, Walker made adjustments, so she experienced them in short truncated moments.</p><p class=dh>She desired color and more color, and she had big wood planters built for her garden where she had annuals planted. During winters, she would fill them up with pansies. She loved Easter egg hunts and hosted parties in her backyard every Sunday.</p><p class=dh>The star's garden also boasted a variety of flowers, including red and white snapdragons, a pink hybrid tea rose, a pink Cestrum, and a gold breath of heaven. All these made the garden perfect for chilled-out Sunday afternoon parties, as did a teak table and chairs that stood under a thicket of giant-timber bamboo.</p><p class=dh>During Easter, she would set up a special place in her garden as a petting zoo spot for the children, and sometimes she would book performers for outdoor acrobatic entertainment.</p><p class=dh>The Thanksgiving holiday was no different. It meant that Taylor would be hosting one of her famous fancy holiday meals, and fifty or more people would be gathered around the table to experience the greatness that was her meals.
